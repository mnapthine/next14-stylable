Stylable offers a [boilerplate utility](https://stylable.io/docs/getting-started/boilerplate) that can be used to bootstrap new projects from a list of templates.

## Tooling

### Stylable Intelligence

Install the [stylable-intelligence VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.stylable-intelligence) which supports code completions, diagnostics, go to definitions, syntax highlighting and more. It's a must have for working with Stylable.

### Stylable config file

The `stylable.config.js` file acts as a central place where you can write your top level configuration for the entire project, so that they are re-used across builds and integrations, and reduce code duplications.

The configuration file should be located in the project root directory in order to be picked up automatically.

```js
// stylable.config.js
const { stcConfig } = require("@stylable/cli");

// use the `stcConfig` function to get type completion and validation
exports.stcConfig = stcConfig({
  // build type definitions for all stylesheets into the st-types directory
  options: {
    srcDir: "./src",
    outDir: "./st-types",
    dts: true,
  },
});
```

See [stylable-config docs](https://stylable.io/docs/getting-started/stylable-config)

### Stylable CLI

Depending on your integration you would have installed [@stylable/cli](https://stylable.io/docs/getting-started/tooling/cli) as a dependancy. The CLI (Command Line Interface) is a low-level utility used for working with Stylable projects directly.

**Example:** Use the CLI to watch for `.st.css` file changes and build the stylable types.

```bash
npx stc --cjs false --dts -w
```
