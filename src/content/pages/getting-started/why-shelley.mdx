'Why' indeed, but then again 'Why not?' ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If you are a fan of CSS and like/need to control the CSS used in your project then Shelley might be for you. if this idea repulses you ü•π then maybe go for something else, there is a lot of choice out there.

## Reasons to consider

- You 'craft' HTML want it to be re-themable.
- You love writing and maintaining your own CSS.
- You beleive in the decoupled nature of CSS and HTML.
- You want inclusivity/accessibility out of the box.
- You don't want to be tied to a specific design system.
- You want to build your own component library on top of base components.
- You use Stylable already and would like a base set of components.
- You don't like CSS in JS.
- You want export your CSS for use outside of React.

@todo add more reasons ü§£ well, maybe but expand on these more especially the last one as its super useful if you need to provide a 3rd party with your 'Headers and Footers' as part of a branded service.
