## Configure Stylable

Shelley has a peer dependancy on [Stylable](https://stylable.io) as its styling solution so we need to set that up first. If you haven't had a look through the Stylable docs yet we suggest go through the [Getting Started](https://stylable.io/docs/getting-started/intro) section first just to get a feel of what is there.

As indicated in the Stylable docs there two main ways of starting out, boilerplates and manual config.

### Boilerplates

- [Create Stylable App](/getting-started/create-stylable-app) - Webpack and Rollup templates provided by Wix.

### Manual config

- [NextJS](/getting-started/next-js)
- [Webpack](https://stylable.io/docs/getting-started/webpack-integration)

### Typescript

We generally assume that you will be using Typescript with Shelley and Stylable and suggest you check out [Stylable's Typescript Integration guide](https://stylable.io/docs/getting-started/typescript-integration).

_Tip_: For VSCode install [Stylable Intelligence](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.stylable-intelligence) extension in your editor to get the most out of Stylable, it's great, a must have!.

## Configure Shelley

Once you have a project with Stylable setup you can go ahead and install Shelley.

```
npm i @actionishope/shelley
```

@todo instructions on how to get the base class applied and a basic usage example.

Note: If you are using one of our boilerplates this will be already done.

## Where to next?
