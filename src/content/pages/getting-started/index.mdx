## Configure Stylable

Shelley uses [Stylable](https://stylable.io) as its styling solution, so we need to set that up first.

Stylable is a CSS preprocessor developed by Wix Engineering and helps power 50 million user websites within Wix. If you don't know much about Stylable (no problem) we suggest that you get familar with the [Stylable docs](https://stylable.io/docs/getting-started/intro) to get a feel for it.

As indicated in the Stylable docs there two main ways of starting with it, boilerplates and manual config.

### Boilerplates

- [Create Stylable App](/getting-started/create-stylable-app) - Webpack and Rollup templates provided by Wix.

### Manual config

- [NextJS](/getting-started/next-js)
- [Webpack](https://stylable.io/docs/getting-started/webpack-integration)

## Configure Shelley

Once you have a project with stylable setup you can go ahead and install Shelley.

```
npm i @actionishope/shelley
```

Note: If you are using one of our boilerplates this will be already done.

### Styling

Fo information on styling see our [Styling Guide](/styling) and also look our for the 'Styling' tab on component pages which will have more information on that specific component.
