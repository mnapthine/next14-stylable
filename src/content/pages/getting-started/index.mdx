## 1. Stylable

Shelley uses [Stylable](https://stylable.io) as its styling solution, so we need to set that up.

Stylable is a CSS preprocessor developed by Wix Engineering and helps power 50 million user websites within Wix.

If you don't know much about Stylable we suggest that you get familar with the [stylable documentation](https://stylable.io/docs/getting-started/intro).

### Configure

When it comes configuring Stylable with your project you have some options:

- [Create Stylable App](/getting-started/create-stylable-app) - Simple templates for webpack and rollup provided by Wix.
- [NextJS](/getting-started/next-js)
- [Webpack](https://stylable.io/docs/getting-started/webpack-integration)
- [Typescript](https://stylable.io/docs/getting-started/typescript-integration)

### Tooling

Install the [stylable-intelligence VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.stylable-intelligence) which supports code completions, diagnostics, go to definitions, syntax highlighting and more. It's a must have for working with Stylable.

Read our guide to [Working with Stylable](/getting-started/working-with-stylable).

## 2. Shelley
