## Stylable

Shelley uses [Stylable](https://stylable.io) as its styling solution, so we need to set that up first.

Stylable is a CSS preprocessor developed by Wix Engineering and helps power 50 million user websites within Wix.

If you don't know much about Stylable (no problem) we suggest that you get familar with the [Stylable docs](https://stylable.io/docs/getting-started/intro) to get a feel for it.

### Configure

As indicated in the Stylable docs there two main ways of starting with Stylable, boilerplates and manual config.

**Boilerplates:**

- [Create Stylable App](/getting-started/create-stylable-app) - webpack and rollup templates provided by Wix.

**Manual:**

- [NextJS](/getting-started/next-js)
- [Webpack](https://stylable.io/docs/getting-started/webpack-integration)
