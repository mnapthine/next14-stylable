## Introduction

Shelley is a headless (unstyled) component library for React that leverages Adobes react-aria hooks for to maintain `a11y` standards and [Stylable](https://stylable.io) as its styling solution.

It offers you full control of the CSS and as such is more [CSS Zen Garden](https://csszengarden.com/) over [Atomic/Utility](https://acss.io/) as a fundermental.

There is nothing stopping you from using atomic/utility classes for some alignment but if you want full blown tailwind then more composable libraries like [Adobe's React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/components.html) (using the same hooks) are gonna be a better fit for you.

### What is Stylable?

Stylable is a CSS preprocessor developed by Wix Engineering and helps power 50 million user websites within Wix. If you don't know much about Stylable _(no problem)_ we suggest that you get familar with the [Stylable docs](https://stylable.io/docs/getting-started/intro) to get a feel for it.

Some highlights of Stylable include:

- Scoped component styles to stop leakage.
- Abilty to define a component CSS API defining its state and its parts.
- 'In the spirit of CSS' pseudo selectors to target state and parts from outside.
- A type system aiming to do for CSS what TypeScript did for JavaScript.
- Developer tooling offering language-intelligence and code completion.
- A powerful CLI, a low-level utility for working with Stylable projects directly.

To be able to pierce the component and target its parts from outside is a killer feature of Stylable. Much like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Shelley is all about it's parts!

Special shout out to the [Wix Engineering](https://www.wix.engineering/) crew for their support and work on Stylable and more recently [Codux](https://www.codux.com/) which aims to make a space for designers and developers to collaborate.
